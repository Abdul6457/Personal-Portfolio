Personal Portfolio
This personal portfolio project is a showcase of my skills, services, and achievements as a web designer and front-end developer. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on responsiveness, interactivity, and modern design principles.

Project Overview
The portfolio consists of several sections, each designed to highlight different aspects of my work:

Header Section: This section includes a dynamic introduction with my name, title, and a brief description of what I do. The header is designed to grab attention with a clean layout and intuitive navigation.

About Me: A detailed section that outlines my background, skills, and expertise in web design and development. This section is designed to be both informative and engaging, with a focus on my journey and what sets me apart in the industry.

Services: A visually appealing section that details the services I offer, such as web design, UX/UI design, and front-end development. Each service is represented by interactive 3D icons or models that users can hover over to learn more.

Skills: This section showcases my technical skills with interactive 3D elements that represent each skill. It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Git, and GitHub, with each icon offering additional information upon interaction.

Projects: A portfolio of my work, featuring projects I've completed for clients. Each project is displayed with a brief description, key technologies used, and a link to the live project or GitHub repository.

Achievements: A section dedicated to highlighting my professional achievements, such as award-winning designs and successful project deliveries. The text is crafted to convey professionalism and dedication to excellence.

FAQ: A collapsible accordion section styled similarly to Netflix's FAQ, providing answers to common questions about my services, technologies used, consultation process, and contact methods. The accordion is fully interactive, with smooth transitions and an intuitive layout.

Footer: The footer includes my name and title ("Web Designer"), a brief tagline related to the portfolio, navigation links (Home, Services, Contact Us), and social media icons with hover effects. The footer also features a copyright line to ensure the content is protected.
